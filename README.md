# RAPIDS
Repo created as a part of DIS FA 2020

The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries gives you the freedom to execute end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs.
The notebooks in this repo are tested using RAPIDS 0.15 nightly build in Titan RTX GPU and Blazing SQL.
Link for using Blazing SQL: app.blazingsql.com

There are 3 files under this repo:
